### ðŸ§¬ ðŸ–¥ Cart Centering Program - Genetic Programming

This program uses data structures such as binary trees and stacks in C++ to represent mathematical equations used to model the movement of a cart based on its velocity and position. The program's goal is to mutate trees through generations to create the most efficient equation to center the cart.

Here is a Quick demonstration of the C++ program:
