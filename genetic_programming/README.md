### ðŸ§¬ðŸ–¥ Cart Centering Program - Genetic Programming

This program uses data structures such as binary trees and stacks in C++ to represent mathematical equations used to model the movement of a cart based on its velocity and position. The goal of the program is to mutate trees through generations in an attempt to crete the most efficient equation to center the cart.

Here is a Quick demonstration of the C++ program:
